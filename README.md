pve-datapacks
=============
This datapack contains custom loot tables supporting gameplay for `p.nerd.nu`
("PvE").


Contents
--------
Some vanilla Minecraft 1.13.2 chest loot tables are modified with additional
custom drops. These loot tables have names of the form
`minecraft:chests/<name>`.

For simplicity, the augmented vanilla Minecraft chest loot tables are defined
in terms of an unmodified copy of the vanilla Minecraft chest loot tables,
renamed as `minecraft:vanilla/chests/<name>`.

The datapack also contains custom chest loot tables used by custom structures
generated using OpenTerrainGenerator according to the configurations in
[totemo/OTGConfigs](https://github.com/totemo/OTGConfigs). Those loot tables
have names in the `otgconfigs:` namespace, e.g.
`otgconfigs:chests/end_villager_pod`.


Installation
------------
Download the zip file from [the releases page](https://github.com/totemo/pve-datapacks/releases)
and place it in the `world/datapacks/` folder under the server directory.


Testing Loot Tables
-------------------
It's prohibitively inconvenient to have to find a generated structure in order
to verify the correct operation of these loot tables. The commands listed below
can check and set the loot table associated with a chest.

### Minecraft 1.13.2 (And Later Versions) Loot Table Commands
 * You can set the loot table of a pre-existing chest (under your feet):
```
/data merge block ~ ~ ~ {LootTable:"otgconfigs:chests/end_villager_pod"}
```
 * You can also *read* the loot table (and other NBT data) of that chest:
```
/data get block ~ ~ ~
```
 
### Minecraft 1.12.2 Loot Table Commands
 * You can set the loot table of a pre-existing chest (under your feet):
```
/blockdata ~ ~-1 ~ {LootTable:"otgconfigs:chests/end_egg_endermite"}
```
 * You can also *read* the loot table (and other NBT data) of that chest:
```
/blockdata ~ ~-1 ~ {}
```


Building
--------
If you would prefer to build the datapack yourself rather than download it from
here, follow these instructions.

You will need a UNIX-like environment with:

 * Bourne Again Shell (Bash)
 * GNU C Preprocessor
 * `jq` Command-Line JSON Processor
 * Java `jar` utility
 * `zip` command line utility
 
Clone this repository and then run `build.sh`:
```
git clone https://github.com/totemo/pve-datapacks
cd pve-datapacks/chest_loot
./build.sh
```


Updating
--------
The procedure for updating these loot tables in preparation for a new rev is roughly as follows (a UNIX-like environment is assumed):

 1. Change to the `chest_loot` subdirectory of where the repository has been cloned.
```
cd chest_loot
```
 2. Update file `target_settings` with the new revision's Minecraft version.
 3. List all vanilla Minecraft loot tables for that version:
```
. target_settings
./list_chest_loot_tables.sh $MINECRAFT_DIR/versions/$MINECRAFT_VERSION/${MINECRAFT_VERSION}.jar
```
 4. Add any new vanilla loot tables to the checklist of loot tables to consider in the planning spreadsheet.
 1. Assign vanilla `minecraft:` namespace and `otgconfigs:` namespace loot tables to groups wherein all tables in the group have the same configuration of custom item drops (weight, min and max items).
 1. Label each group with a letter, starting with `a`. The custom item drops for the group will be represented by a single pool, represented as a preprocessor macro in a text file in the `chest_loot/pools/` subdirectory. Currently there are pools `a` through `i`.
 1. Design the the drops for each group and write the corresponding pool macros, e.g. `#define POOL_A` in `chest_loot/pools/a`.
 1. For each `otgconfigs:` namespaced loot table, decide which vanilla loot table it should be based on. Loot tables that override vanilla `minecraft:` namespaced tables will simply inherit the vanilla loot table and add an extra pool for the custom drops.
 1. Using BeastMaster's `config.yml` as the definitive source on item properties:
   * Check for mistyped lore strings on items:
```
grep -A3 lore: config.yml | sort -u
```
   * Update `chest_loot/items/all-items` with new macros named after the new revision's custom items.
   * Add one pool for each item to `chest_loot/templates/otgconfigs/loot_tables/chests/all_items.json.template`. When assigned to a chest, that loot table supplies one of each item.
 10. Update all of the `chest_loot/templates/**/*.json.template` files according to the selected pool assignments and inherited vanilla loot tables.
 1. Build the loot tables:
```
cd chest_loot
./clean.sh && ./build.sh && cp dist/chest_loot.zip ~/minecraft/test1.15/world/datapacks/ && mark2 send ~restart
```
   * The command will vary depending on the server name and directory.
   * If the preprocessor spouts errors, fix your macros.
   * If `jq` complains of malformed JSON, you will need to temporarily remove `| jq . --indent 4` in order to see the raw preprocessor output that `jq` is being asked to format. The file containing the malformed text will be the last one before the error message, in the `src/` directory.
   > *NOTE: the `src/` directory contains the output of `generate.sh`, which is then packed into a ZIP file to make the datapack. It is the source code of the datapack. However, the input of `generate.sh` is in the `templates/` directory.*
 

Checking Items
--------------
To verify that all chest loot items are identical to the items in the BeastMaster configuration:

 1. Create an empty chest.
 2. Stand on it and run:
```
/data merge block ~ ~ ~ {LootTable:"otgconfigs:chests/all_items"}
```
 3. Take all of the items in the chest, and then use BeastMaster commands to get the same items from BeastMaster, e.g.:
```
/beast-item get golem-soul
```
   * If the BeastMaster item stacks with the one in the chest, then they are the same.

In the case of obscure stacking problems, such as those caused by Spigot 1.16's
new text representation (see "Spigot 1.16 Text Representation" below), you can
drop the item on the ground and run:
```
/data get entity @e[type=item,distance=..10,limit=1]
```
to see the NBT data of the item.


Checking Loot Tables
--------------------
When verifying loot tables, there are two points to consider:

 1. Does the table include the correct inherited vanilla loot?
 2. Does the table include the right additional custom items for its pool/group?

To check Point 1, you need to create at least one chest for each loot table type. To check Point 2, you want to see a few examples of custom loot from the same group.

Since all loot tables in the same group share the same pool definition file, a reasonable test is therefore to test all loot tables (by creating a chest with that loot) at least once until you have seen a few examples of custom loot from each of the pools.


Spigot 1.16 Text Representation
-------------------------------
The way that Spigot represents text in 1.16 is the subject, at the time of
writing, of a couple of issues on the Spigot tracker:

 * https://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/browse/SPIGOT-5063
 * https://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/browse/SPIGOT-5964

In Minecraft 1.16, Spigot converts embedded legacy character codes into JSON 
formatted text. It sets the "text" field of the JSON object to the empty 
string and puts a JSON text object in the "extra" array of objects. In
addition, when the "color" key is present, Spigot will set the value of 
all five formatting flags (bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough and
obfuscated).

For example, "ยง3Golem Soul" would typically be rendered in JSON as:
```
"name": {
    "text": "Golem Soul",
    "color": "dark_aqua"
}
```
but is instead represented by:
```
"name": {
    "extra": [
        {
            "text": "Golem Soul",
            "color": "dark_aqua",
            "bold": false,
            "italic": false,
            "underlined": false,
            "strikethrough": false,
            "obfuscated": false
        }
    ],
    "text": ""
}

```

Interestingly, in the case of lore text with only a single formatting flag
("italic": true) and no "color" setting, Spigot only stored the italic flag;
not the other 4 flags.
